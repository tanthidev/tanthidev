What is Neumorphic?
---------------------

“Neumorphism” is a new slang term in design circles — co-created by. Michal Malewicz. — which essentially crosses the words “new” and “skeuomorphism”. 
Essentially, it's a new, minimal way to design with a soft, extruded plastic look. 
It's almost as if the interface has been vacuum-formed.
